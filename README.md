# NHS Coronavirus Vaccination Appointment Checker

A quick automated service that monitors the UK [NHS coronavirus vaccination booking page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/) for changes to the eligibility criteria.

Notifications are sent out via the [Pushover Message API](https://pushover.net/api) and as native desktop notifications on macOS and Windows. Add API credentials to a `.env` file for Pushover.

Use responsibly. In most cases, your GP or the NHS will [automatically notify you](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/how-you-will-be-contacted/) once you are eligible.
